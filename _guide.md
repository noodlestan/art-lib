# Guide: Art Cli

> Host and manage the Art Cli shared libraries and tools, and their planning artefacts.

Monorepo containing the Art Cli roadmap, library source code, and their backlogs.

Uses Workflow: Planning Work with one backlog per package, coordinating with Workflow: Roadmapping from one project-wide roadmap.

## Recommended Reading

Agents SHOULD scan these files for relevant clarifications when faced with ambiguity or omissions that may result from missing definitions.

- `_guide.md` — this file: system overview, layout, setup, verification.
- `_records/project.art` — the project record.
- `_records/repository.art` — the repository record.

## Repository Layout

```
_guide.md           — this file
_backlog/           — plans, instructions, reports
_records/           — project, repository, namespace, and license records
architecture/       — repository-level architecture documentation
libs/               — library packages
```

## Records Management

Records are co-located with the resources they describe in `_records/` directories:

- **Project:** `_records/project.art`
- **Repository:** `_records/repository.art`
- **Namespace:** `_records/namespace.art`
- **License:** `_records/license.art`

## Workflows

Projects in this repository use the following workflows:

| Workflow / Path                                                            | Purpose                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/planning-work/workflow.art`     | Create and manage work item lifecycles, collecting operational instructions according to context. |
| **Delegating Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/delegating-work/workflow.art` | Organize work delegation to sub-agents with validation, execution, and verification.              |
| **Executing Work** `$DOMAINS/work/workflows/executing-work/workflow.art`   | Organize work execution by sub-agents to produce completed, verified outcomes and feedback.       |
| **Roadmapping** `$DOMAINS/roadmaps/workflows/roadmapping/workflow.art`     | Coordinate and align work milestones across projects and initiatives.                             |

### Planning Work

- The backlog lives at `_backlog/` with subdirectories such as `/3-now` and `/4-next/`.
- The short-term focus is captured in `_backlog/_parking-lot.md`.
- The roadmap lives at `_roadmap/` with the project-level parking lot at `_roadmap/_parking-lot.md`.
